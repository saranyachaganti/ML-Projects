## The projects in this repository are done during my 100 days of machine learning challenge. 

### List of Projects : 

###  1) <ins> Text based classification </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/IRIS
##### Dataset : IRIS Dataset (UCI Machine learning repository)
##### Agenda : Classify the class of the type of flower given the measurements
##### Description : This ML Porject is a multivariate dataset based on types of IRIS flower. When we give few parameters as inputs the model predicts on which type of flower it belongs to either Iris setosa, Iris virginica or Iris versicolor

### 2)<ins> Loan Approval - Loan Approval project </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/Loan
##### Dataset : Loan prediction ( Kaggle)
##### Agenda : To predict the product a customer is likely to buy
##### Description : This project consists of deciding the output which is based on various parameters such as salary, credit history, education etc. . A detailed overview of graphs are plotted such as correlation plots, Linear plots etc. for a better intuition for exploratory data analysis

### 3) <ins> Market Basket Analysis </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/Market-Basket-Analysis
##### Dataset : Online retail ( Kaggle)
##### Agenda : Decide weather the person's loan can be approved or not based on a few parameters
##### Description : Through this project you can find intresting associations and relationships among the datasets (the algorithm ive used can also be applied to a  recommendaton engine) .For example if you buy read you are most likely to buy Jam or butter or both. So the owner of the grocery store can put an offer on both combined for more sales. 

### 4) <ins> Product Identification - Fashion MNIST project </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/Fashion-MNIST-Project
##### Dataset : Fashion MNIST ( Inbuilt in keras)
##### Agenda : Identify the item in the image
##### Description : The dataset has 70k+ labelled images through which when given any input it identifies it as a hat/sweater/ankle boot or something else based on the 10 classes we have 

### 5) <ins> Sentiment Analysis - Movie review classification project </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/Movie-Review-Classification-Project
##### Dataset : Imdb inbuilt dataset in keras
##### Agenda : This project classifies the movie review as a good review or a bad one
##### Description : The project lso deals with a little bit of NLP domain through which we do the data preprocesssing and tune the data according to our needs. Also extended the project where you personally can give any movie review on your own and it gives out the classified output i.e: Good or Bad

### 6) <ins> Recommendation Engine </ins>

##### Code : https://github.com/saranyachaganti/ML-Projects/tree/master/Movie-Recommendation-Engine
##### Dataset : My github
##### Agenda : Recommend 5 movies based on the input you give
##### Description : A movie recomendation engine is like your netflix / amazon which constantly reminds you what you like and what you're going to like based on your watch list . In this project you give a movie of your choice and it reccomends 5 other movies which are related to that movie.
